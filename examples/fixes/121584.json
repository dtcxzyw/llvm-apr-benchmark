        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's see. The problem is in the InstCombine pass where the transformation for srem is miscompiling. The specific test case involves srem of a shl and a mul, and the current code is replacing it with a sub which isn't correct in all cases.\n\nLooking at the Alive2 example, when X is -1 (which is 255 in i8), the original code computes srem(-128, -127) which should be -1. But the transformed code returns sub 0, X, which would be 1. That's wrong.\n\nSo the bug is in the part of simplifyIRemMulShl where it's generating the wrong result. Let's look at the code in simplifyIRemMulShl.\n\nIn the code, there's a condition where Y >= Z (in the case of srem, and BO0HasNSW and BO1HasNSW are true). Then it creates a multiplication of X with (Y srem Z). But in the test case, Y is 128 (from shl X,7) and Z is 127 (from mul X,127). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the code in the test is:\n\n%BO0 = mul nsw i8 %X, 127\n%BO1 = shl nsw i8 %X, 7\n\nSo for BO0, it's X * 127, and BO1 is X << 7, which is X * 128. So in terms of the code, Y is 128 (from BO1) and Z is 127 (from BO0). So Y is 128, Z is 127. Then Y >= Z is true (128 > 127). Then the code would trigger the code that creates a mul of X and (Y srem Z). Y srem Z is 128 % 127, which is 1. So the code would generate X * 1, which is X. But in the test case, the incorrect code is generating -X. So why is that?\n\nWait, in the code, when Y.uge(Z) (which is Y >= Z for unsigned?), but wait, Y and Z are APInts here. But Y is 128 (for i8, that's 0x80, which is -128 in signed), and Z is 127. So Y.uge(Z) would be comparing 128 vs 127 as unsigned, which is 128 > 127 (true). But in the case of srem, we need to consider the signed comparison. Wait, but the code uses Y.uge(Z) regardless of IsSRem? That's a problem. Because for srem, Y and Z should be treated as signed values. But the code is checking Y.uge(Z), which is an unsigned comparison. So in the test case, Y is 128 (which is -128 in signed i8), Z is 127. So Y.sge(Z) would be false (-128 < 127), but Y.uge(Z) is true (128 > 127). So the code is using the wrong comparison here. That's the root cause.\n\nAh! So the code in simplifyIRemMulShl checks Y.uge(Z) when handling srem. But for srem, the condition should be based on the signed values. So instead of using Y.uge(Z), it should use Y.sge(Z) when IsSRem is true.\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nif (Y.uge(Z) && (IsSRem ? (BO0HasNSW && BO1HasNSW) : BO0HasNUW)) {\n\nSo here, Y.uge(Z) is always an unsigned comparison. But when IsSRem is true, we should check if Y is greater than or equal to Z in the signed sense. So for the test case, Y is 128 (which is -128 in 8-bit signed), Z is 127. Y.sge(Z) would be false, so the condition would not trigger. But the current code uses Y.uge(Z) which is true, leading to the incorrect transformation.\n\nTherefore, the fix is to change Y.uge(Z) to (IsSRem ? Y.sge(Z) : Y.uge(Z)).\n\nSo modifying the condition in the code from:\n\nif (Y.uge(Z) && (IsSRem ? (BO0HasNSW && BO1HasNSW) : BO0HasNUW)) {\n\nto:\n\nif ((IsSRem ? Y.sge(Z) : Y.uge(Z)) && (IsSRem ? (BO0HasNSW && BO1HasNSW) : BO0HasNUW)) {\n\nThat way, for srem, we check the signed comparison, and for urem, the unsigned.\n\nIn the test case, Y.sge(Z) would be (-128) >= 127? No, it's -128 < 127, so the condition is false. Therefore, this code path would not be taken, and the transformation would not happen. Therefore, the incorrect replacement with X * (Y%Z) (which is X * 1) would not occur. Instead, the code would return nullptr, and the srem would not be simplified. That would prevent the miscompilation.\n\nSo the fix is to use the correct signed/unsigned comparison based on IsSRem."

        "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to fix the miscompilation in the `simplifyIRemMulShl` function based on the test failure. The test `rem-mul-shl.ll` is failing because the transformation is producing incorrect results for certain cases. Let's look at the problem.\n\nThe original code had a transformation that replaced `srem (shl X, 7), (mul X, 127)` with `sub nsw 0, X`, but when X is -1 (in i8), this leads to incorrect results. The test case shows that when X is -1, the source computes -1, but the target computes 1, which is wrong.\n\nLooking at the code in `simplifyIRemMulShl`, there's a part that checks if Y >= Z and then transforms the remainder. For the srem case, Y is 128 (from shl X,7 which is 1<<7=128) and Z is 127 (from mul X,127). Here, Y.sge(Z) is true (128 is -128 in i8, which is less than 127 in signed comparison). Wait, no, in 8-bit signed integers, 128 is actually -128. So Y is -128 and Z is 127. Then, -128.sge(127) would be false. That means the condition `Y.sge(Z)` when Y is -128 and Z is 127 would evaluate to false, so the transformation shouldn't apply. But maybe the code incorrectly allowed it.\n\nIn the code, the condition for Y >= Z was using `Y.uge(Z)` for urem and `Y.sge(Z)` for srem. However, when Y and Z are APInts, comparing them with sge might not work correctly if they are not sign-extended properly. Wait, but APInt's sge does handle the sign correctly. Let me check the code.\n\nIn the code, after matching Y and Z as the coefficients, when handling srem, the code checks if `Y.sge(Z)` and then proceeds. But in the test case, Y is 128 (which is 0x80 in i8, interpreted as -128) and Z is 127. So Y.sge(Z) would be -128 >= 127? No, that's false. So the transformation should not trigger in this case. But according to the Alive2 example, the transformation was applied, leading to the wrong result.\n\nWait, why did the code apply the transformation in the test case? Let's look at the conditions. The code has:\n\nif (YGECond && (IsSRem ? (BO0HasNSW && BO1HasNSW) : BO0HasNUW)) {\n\nIn the test case, BO0 is `shl nsw i8 %X, 7`, which has NSW. BO1 is `mul nsw i8 %X, 127`, which has NSW. So for srem, the condition is (BO0HasNSW && BO1HasNSW). So if Y.sge(Z) is true, then the transformation would trigger. But in the test case, Y is 128 (0x80, -128) and Z is 127. So Y.sge(Z) would be (-128).sge(127) which is false. Therefore, the transformation shouldn't trigger. But according to the test failure, the code did trigger, leading to the incorrect result.\n\nHmm, maybe the code is calculating Y and Z incorrectly. Let's check how Y and Z are captured. The code uses `MatchShiftOrMulXC` for Op0 and Op1. For Op0 (BO1 in the test case is `shl nsw i8 %X, 7`), the code matches it as a shl, so Y becomes 1 << 7 = 128. For Op1 (BO0 is `mul nsw i8 %X, 127`), Z is 127. So Y is 128 (0x80 in i8, which is -128 in signed), Z is 127.\n\nThen, for srem, the code checks Y.sge(Z). Let's compute that. Y is -128, Z is 127. So -128 >= 127? No. So the condition Y.sge(Z) is false. Therefore, the code should not enter that branch. So why did the transformation happen?\n\nWait, perhaps there's a bug in the code where the Y and Z values are being treated as unsigned when they should be considered as signed. Let me check the code again.\n\nIn the code, when handling shifts, the code sets Y as 1 << shift_amt. For example, a shl X, 7 would set Y to 128. But in the case of i8, 128 is an 8-bit value, which is 0x80, which is -128 in signed. So Y is stored as an APInt with value 128 (bit pattern 10000000). When comparing using sge, it should treat Y as a signed integer. So Y.sge(Z) where Y is 128 (APInt for i8) and Z is 127 (APInt for i8), then Y is -128 and Z is 127. So Y.sge(Z) is (-128 >= 127) \u2192 false. So the code should not take this branch. Therefore, why is the transformation being applied?\n\nWait, maybe the code is incorrectly using Y.uge(Z) instead of Y.sge(Z) for the srem case. Let's check the code:\n\nIn the code, the line:\n\nbool YGECond = IsSRem ? Y.sge(Z) : Y.uge(Z);\n\nBut in the test case, IsSRem is true (since it's srem). So YGECond is Y.sge(Z). Which is false. Therefore, the code should not proceed into the branch that creates the mul with rem YZ.\n\nBut according to the test failure, the code did apply the transformation. So maybe there's a miscalculation in the code.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when matching shifts, the code treats the coefficients as if they are multiplied by (1 << shift_amt), but in the case of a left shift with nsw, the actual value might be negative. For example, in the test case, X is -1. Shl nsw i8 -1, 7 gives -128 (since (-1 << 7) is -128 in 8-bit with nsw). The code treats the shl as equivalent to multiplying by 128 (1<<7), but when X is negative, that multiplication would result in -128, which is correct. However, when the code simplifies the srem, it uses the formula (mul X, (rem Y, Z)), where Y is 128 and Z is 127. The rem here is srem(128, 127), which in 8-bit is srem(-128, 127). The srem of -128 by 127 is -1. So the result should be X * (-1), which is -X. But in the code's transformation, when Y >= Z is not true, this branch isn't taken. But in the test case, the code was transformed into sub nsw 0, X. Which suggests that the code did apply the transformation where Y >= Z, but that condition should not hold.\n\nWait, but in the test case, the original code was:\n\n%BO0 = mul nsw i8 %X, 127\n%BO1 = shl nsw i8 %X, 7\n%r = srem i8 %BO1, %BO0\n\nThe code is supposed to simplify this. In the original code, when the code matches the pattern (srem (shl X,7), (mul X, 127)), Y is 128, Z is 127. Since Y (128) is greater than Z (127) in unsigned terms (128 > 127), but in signed terms, Y is -128 which is less than Z (127). So for srem, the code checks Y.sge(Z), which is false. Therefore, the code should not trigger the transformation. But according to the test failure, the code is replacing the srem with -X, which implies that the code did trigger that transformation. How?\n\nLooking back at the code, perhaps there's a mistake in the code where the Y and Z are being treated as the same type (APInt) but with different bit widths? No, in the code, when matching shifts, the code creates Y as 1 << shift_amt, which is in the same bit width as the shift amount. For example, in the test case, shift_amt is 7 (i8), so 1 << 7 is 128 (8 bits). The mul is with 127, which is 8 bits. So Y and Z are both 8-bit APInts.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is incorrectly using Y.uge(Z) instead of Y.sge(Z) for srem. Let's check the code again. The line in the code is:\n\nbool YGECond = IsSRem ? Y.sge(Z) : Y.uge(Z);\n\nYes, that's correct. For srem, it uses signed comparison. So in the test case, Y.sge(Z) is false. Therefore, the code should not enter that branch. Then why is the test case failing?\n\nWait, maybe the code has a different path. Let's look at the code again. There are two other branches:\n\n1. If RemYZ is zero and BO0NoWrap: replace with 0.\n2. If RemYZ == Y and BO1NoWrap: replace with mul Y.\n\nIn the test case:\n\nY is 128, Z is 127. RemYZ is srem(128,127). Let's compute that. Since in 8-bit signed:\n\n128 is -128, 127 is 127.\n\nsrem(-128, 127) is -128 - (127 * (-2)) \u2192 -128 - (-254) = 126. Wait, no. srem(a, b) is a - b * sdiv(a, b).\n\nsdiv(-128, 127) is -1 (since 127 * -1 = -127, which is greater than -128). So srem(-128, 127) is -128 - (127 * -1) = -128 + 127 = -1. So RemYZ is -1 (0xff in i8). So RemYZ is not zero, so first condition not taken. RemYZ is -1 (0xff) which is not equal to Y (0x80), so the second condition is not taken. So the code should return nullptr, meaning no transformation. But according to the test failure, the code is applying a transformation. Therefore, the code must be entering the third branch (Y >= Z) somehow.\n\nWait, in the code's third condition:\n\nif (YGECond && (IsSRem ? (BO0HasNSW && BO1HasNSW) : BO0HasNUW)) {\n\nBut in the test case, YGECond is false (Y.sge(Z) is false), so the code shouldn't enter this branch. Therefore, the code should not perform any transformation, and the srem should remain as is. But the test case shows that the transformation is being applied, leading to an incorrect result. So why is the code applying the transformation when it shouldn't?\n\nAh! Wait, the test case that's failing is `srem_XY_XZ_with_CY_gt_CZ_drop_nsw_commuted`. Let's check the test case in the LLVM test file.\n\nLooking at the test case in rem-mul-shl.ll:\n\ndefine i8 @srem_XY_XZ_with_CY_gt_CZ_drop_nsw_commuted(i8 noundef %X) {\n  %BO0 = mul nsw i8 %X, 127\n  %BO1 = shl nsw i8 %X, 7\n  %r = srem i8 %BO1, %BO0\n  ret i8 %r\n}\n=>\ndefine i8 @srem_XY_XZ_with_CY_gt_CZ_drop_nsw_commuted(i8 noundef %X) {\n  %r = sub nsw i8 0, %X\n  ret i8 %r\n}\n\nThe transformation is replacing the srem with sub nsw 0, %X. According to the code in simplifyIRemMulShl, this would be the case if the code is taking the third branch (Y >= Z), which requires YGECond to be true. But in reality, Y is 128 (signed -128) and Z is 127. So Y.sge(Z) is false. Therefore, the code shouldn't apply this transformation. But the code does, leading to the failure.\n\nSo why is the code applying the transformation? It must be that the code is entering the third branch even when Y.sge(Z) is false. This suggests a bug in the code's logic.\n\nLooking at the code again, perhaps there's a miscalculation in how Y and Z are being stored. Let me check how the code captures Y and Z.\n\nIn the test case, Op0 is shl nsw i8 %X,7, which is matched as a shl, so Y is computed as 1 << 7 = 128 (APInt(8, 128)). Op1 is mul nsw i8 %X, 127, so Z is 127 (APInt(8, 127)). Then, for the srem case, Y.sge(Z) is 128.sge(127). But in APInt's sge method, since the values are 8-bit, 128 is treated as a signed value. APInt(8,128) is -128 in two's complement. So Y.sge(Z) would be -128 >= 127 \u2192 false. So YGECond is false, and the code shouldn't take the branch. However, the code is taking the branch and returning the mul with RemYZ.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is comparing Y and Z as unsigned values instead of signed. Let's check the code again. The code uses Y.sge(Z) for srem. But perhaps there's a mistake in how the APInt's sge is calculated. APInt's sge correctly interprets the bit pattern as a signed value. So Y (128) is -128, Z (127) is 127. So sge is false.\n\nBut in the code, the transformation is being applied, which suggests that the condition is being met. Therefore, there's a mistake in the code's logic. Let me check the code again.\n\nWait, looking at the code:\n\nIn the third condition:\n\n// (rem (mul nuw/nsw X, Y), (mul {nsw} X, Z))\n//      if Y >= Z\n//          -> (mul {nuw} nsw X, (rem Y, Z))\nif (YGECond && (IsSRem ? (BO0HasNSW && BO1HasNSW) : BO0HasNUW)) {\n\nIn the test case, BO0 is the shl (Op0), which has NSW. BO1 is the mul (Op1), which has NSW. So (BO0HasNSW && BO1HasNSW) is true. But YGECond is false. So the code shouldn't enter this branch. Therefore, the code should not apply the transformation. But according to the test failure, it's applying it, which is incorrect.\n\nThis suggests that there's another part of the code that is triggering the transformation. Let's check the other parts.\n\nAnother possible branch is the second one:\n\n// (rem (mul X, Y), (mul nuw/nsw X, Z))\n//      if (rem Y, Z) == Y\n//          -> (mul nuw/nsw X, Y)\nif (RemYZ == Y && BO1NoWrap) {\n\nIn the test case, RemYZ is srem(Y, Z) which is srem(128, 127) \u2192 -1 (0xFF), which is not equal to Y (0x80). So this condition is false. Therefore, the code doesn't take this branch.\n\nThe only other branch is the first one, which checks if RemYZ is zero. In the test case, RemYZ is -1, so that's not the case.\n\nTherefore, none of the conditions are met, and the code should return nullptr, leaving the srem as is. However, the test case shows that the code is replacing the srem with a sub instruction. So there must be another transformation in InstCombine that is being applied here, outside of simplifyIRemMulShl.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code in simplifyIRemMulShl is not the only code path. Let's see where simplifyIRemMulShl is called. It's called from commonIRemTransforms, which is called from visitSRem. So maybe there's another optimization in InstCombine that is causing this transformation.\n\nBut according to the initial problem description, the miscompilation is in simplifyIRemMulShl. The Alive2 link shows that the transformation is incorrect, and the code in simplifyIRemMulShl is supposed to handle this case.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is applying the third condition even when Y.sge(Z) is false. Let me check the code again.\n\nWait, maybe the code is using Y.uge(Z) instead of Y.sge(Z) for the srem case. Let me check the code:\n\nThe line in question is:\n\nbool YGECond = IsSRem ? Y.sge(Z) : Y.uge(Z);\n\nYes, for srem, it uses sge. So that's correct. But in the test case, Y.sge(Z) is false. So the code shouldn't enter that branch. Therefore, why is the code applying the transformation?\n\nPerhaps the code is not correctly capturing Y and Z. Let's check the code's logic for matching the operands.\n\nThe code has two patterns to match:\n\n1. Both operands are either mul or shl with the same X and constants Y and Z.\n2. Both operands are shifts of constants by X (e.g., shl C, X).\n\nIn the test case, Op0 is shl X, 7, Op1 is mul X, 127. So the first pattern is matched: Op0 is shl X,7 (which is treated as X * 128), Op1 is mul X, 127. So Y is 128, Z is 127.\n\nNow, when simplifying, the code for srem checks if Y.sge(Z), which is false. Therefore, the code should not create a mul X, (rem Y Z).\n\nBut according to the test failure, the code is generating a sub nsw 0, X, which is equivalent to multiplying X by -1. This suggests that RemYZ is -1 (since 128 srem 127 is -1 in i8), and the code is multiplying X by RemYZ (-1).\n\nBut why would the code do that? It would only do that if the third condition is met. However, in the third condition, YGECond is false, so it shouldn't.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is miscalculating RemYZ. Let's recalculate RemYZ for Y=128 (i8), Z=127 (i8) in srem:\n\nAPInt Y(8, 128); // -128\nAPInt Z(8, 127); // 127\nAPInt RemYZ = Y.srem(Z); // -128 srem 127.\n\nIn APInt's srem calculation, this would be -128 % 127. The result is -1. Because:\n\nsrem(a, b) is the remainder with the same sign as a.\n\n-128 divided by 127 is -1 (since 127 * -1 = -127, which is greater than -128). The remainder is -128 - (-127) = -1.\n\nSo RemYZ is -1 (APInt(8, 0xFF)).\n\nNow, in the code's third condition:\n\nif (YGECond && (IsSRem ? (BO0HasNSW && BO1HasNSW) : BO0HasNUW)) {\n\nBut YGECond is false. So this code shouldn't execute. But in the test case, the transformation is being applied, which suggests that this condition is being met. Therefore, there's a mistake in how YGECond is being calculated.\n\nWait, maybe the code is using Y.uge(Z) for the srem case. Let me check again. No, the code uses Y.sge(Z) for srem. So if Y is -128 and Z is 127, Y.sge(Z) is (-128 >= 127) \u2192 false. Therefore, the code shouldn't enter this branch.\n\nSo why is the code creating a mul with RemYZ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code has a logic error in the condition. Let's look at the code:\n\n// (rem (mul nuw/nsw X, Y), (mul {nsw} X, Z))\n//      if Y >= Z\n//          -> (mul {nuw} nsw X, (rem Y, Z))\n\nBut in the test case, the code is matching:\n\nBO0 is shl nsw X,7 \u2192 which is X * 128 (with NSW)\nBO1 is mul nsw X, 127 \u2192 which is X * 127 (with NSW)\n\nThe code has:\n\nBO0HasNSW = true (since shl has nsw)\nBO1HasNSW = true (since mul has nsw)\n\nSo (IsSRem ? (BO0HasNSW && BO1HasNSW) : BO0HasNUW) \u2192 true.\n\nBut YGECond is false. So the entire condition is false. Therefore, the code shouldn't take this branch.\n\nTherefore, there's no reason for the code to create a mul X, RemYZ (-1). But in the test case, the transformation is doing exactly that. So this suggests that the code is somehow taking this branch even when YGECond is false. But why?\n\nWait, maybe there's a bug in the code where Y and Z are being compared as unsigned instead of signed. Let me re-examine the code.\n\nThe code uses:\n\nbool YGECond = IsSRem ? Y.sge(Z) : Y.uge(Z);\n\nBut maybe the APInt's sge method is not correctly handling the sign. Let's verify.\n\nIn the test case, Y is 128 (8-bit) \u2192 -128, Z is 127 (8-bit) \u2192 127. So Y.sge(Z) should return false. If the code is returning true, that's the problem. But why would that happen?\n\nWait, APInt's sge function compares the values as signed. Let's compute Y.sge(Z):\n\nY is 0x80 (binary 10000000) \u2192 for 8 bits, this is -128.\nZ is 0x7F (binary 01111111) \u2192 127.\n\nSo Y.sge(Z) is (-128) >= 127 \u2192 false. So the condition is false. Therefore, the code shouldn't take the branch. Therefore, the code must be taking a different path.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is not checking for Y >= Z, but instead for Y.uge(Z) even for srem? Let's check the code again.\n\nNo, the code correctly uses Y.sge(Z) for srem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in how Y and Z are captured. For example, in the code's MatchShiftOrMulXC function, when matching a shl, Y is computed as 1 << shift_amt. But in the case of a shl, the shift amount can't be larger than the bit width, but the code is using the same bit width as the shift amount. For example, in an 8-bit shift, the shift amount is 7, which is valid. 1 << 7 is 128, which is correct.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps the code is not capturing the correct Y and Z for the operands. In the test case, Op0 is shl X,7 (Y=128), Op1 is mul X,127 (Z=127). So Y=128, Z=127. So the code's logic is correct here.\n\nSo why is the code applying the transformation? There must be another code path.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is entering the second condition where RemYZ == Y. In this case, RemYZ is -1 (0xFF), and Y is 128 (0x80). These are not equal, so the code shouldn't take this path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the code where the code is using urem instead of srem for RemYZ. Let's check:\n\nAPInt RemYZ = IsSRem ? Y.srem(Z) : Y.urem(Z);\n\nYes, for srem, it's using srem. So RemYZ is correctly -1.\n\nSo none of the conditions are met, and the code returns nullptr, so the srem remains. But according to the test failure, the code is transforming the srem into a sub instruction. That suggests that another part of InstCombine is performing this transformation.\n\nLooking at the Alive2 link, the transformation is supposed to replace the srem with sub nsw 0, X. How is this transformation justified? Let's see:\n\nsrem (shl nsw X,7), (mul nsw X,127) \u2192 sub nsw 0, X.\n\nBut according to the srem rules, this is only valid if X * 128 % (X * 127) equals -X. Let's verify this for X=-1:\n\nX = -1 (i8)\nX * 128 = -128 (i8)\nX * 127 = -127 (i8)\nsrem(-128, -127) = (-128) % (-127) = -1. Which is -X (since X is -1, -X is 1). But the result is -1, which is different from -X. Hence, the transformation is incorrect.\n\nBut why is the code applying this transformation? It must be due to an error in the code logic.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is applying the transformation when Y >= Z in terms of absolute values. But that's not what the code is checking.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code incorrectly assumes that Y and Z are positive. In the test case, Y is 128 (interpreted as -128) and Z is 127. But in the code's logic, when the operations have NSW, it may assume that the product is not overflowing, which for shl X,7 with NSW requires that X is in a range such that X << 7 doesn't overflow. For example, X must be -1 in this case, as shifting -1 (all ones) left by 7 gives 0x80 (which is -128, correct with NSW).\n\nBut the code's transformation for srem when Y >= Z (signed) would be valid if Y and Z are positive. However, when Y is negative and Z is positive, the condition Y >= Z is false, so the code shouldn't apply the transformation.\n\nSo why is the code applying the transformation in the test case?\n\nAh! Wait, maybe the code's logic for checking YGECond is incorrect. Let me look again at the code:\n\nThe code computes Y as 128 (for the shl X,7) and Z as 127. For srem, Y.sge(Z) is false. But perhaps the code is treating Y and Z as unsigned values when they shouldn't be. For example, when the code computes RemYZ as Y.srem(Z), but in this case, Y is -128 and Z is 127, so the srem is -1. Then, the code in the third branch:\n\nBinaryOperator *BO = CreateMulOrShift(RemYZ);\nBO->setHasNoSignedWrap();\nBO->setHasNoUnsignedWrap(BO0HasNUW);\nreturn BO;\n\nBut this branch is only taken if Y >= Z. Which is not the case here. So the code should not create this instruction.\n\nBut the test case's expected transformation is to return -X. So how is this happening?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is applying a different transformation elsewhere. For example, if the code in simplifyIRemMulShl isn't handling this case, maybe another part of InstCombine is. For instance, the code could be simplifying srem (mul X, Y), (mul X, Z) to mul X, srem(Y, Z) under certain conditions. But that's exactly what the code in simplifyIRemMulShl is supposed to handle, with the proper checks.\n\nBut the code in simplifyIRemMulShl has a condition that for srem, Y >= Z (signed) and BO0HasNSW and BO1HasNSW. In the test case, BO0HasNSW and BO1HasNSW are true, but Y >= Z is false. So the code should not apply the transformation.\n\nSo why is the code applying it? There must be a bug in the code's logic.\n\nWait, looking at the code again, the YGECond is calculated as Y.sge(Z) for srem. But when Y is 128 (APInt(8, 128)), which is -128, and Z is 127 (APInt(8,127)), which is 127, Y.sge(Z) returns false. Therefore, the code shouldn't take the third branch.\n\nBut in the test case, the code is applying the transformation. So perhaps the code is using the wrong comparison.\n\nWait, maybe the code is using Y.uge(Z) instead of Y.sge(Z) for the srem case. Let me recheck the code:\n\nNo, the code correctly uses Y.sge(Z) for IsSRem.\n\nAnother possibility: there's a mistake in the code's creation of the mul or shift. For example, maybe when the code is supposed to create a mul X, RemYZ, but RemYZ is -1, which is equivalent to -X. But why would that be the case?\n\nIn the test case, RemYZ is -1 (0xFF in i8). So X * RemYZ would be X * (-1), which is -X. But the code only creates this if Y >= Z. Since Y >= Z is false, the code should not do this. But the test case shows that the code does.\n\nTherefore, the only conclusion is that the code's condition is allowing the transformation when it shouldn't. The error must be in the condition where YGECond is true even when it shouldn't be.\n\nWait, maybe the code is incorrectly calculating Y and Z as unsigned values. For example, when matching the shift, the code treats Y as 1 << shift_amt, which is correct, but when comparing Y and Z for sge, the code is using the unsigned values instead of the signed.\n\nBut APInt's sge method correctly handles signed comparisons. For example, APInt(8, 128).sge(APInt(8, 127)) returns false.\n\nSo why is the code creating the mul instruction? It's possible that the code is missing a check for whether the multiplication would overflow. For example, if X is -1, then X * (-1) is 1, which is correct. But when the code creates a mul with NSW, this requires that the multiplication doesn't overflow. For example, multiplying -1 (i8) by -1 (i8) gives 1, which is within the range. But if X is -128 (i8), then X * -1 is 128, which is out of range for i8 (which is -128 to 127). So the code's transformation would be incorrect in that case.\n\nWait, but in the test case, X is noundef. But according to the test failure example, X is -1 (which is 255 in unsigned i8). So in that case, X * -1 is 1, which is correct. However, the problem is when the code assumes that this transformation is valid for all X, but it's not.\n\nThe code's third condition requires that BO0HasNSW and BO1HasNSW. In the test case, BO0 is shl nsw X,7, which requires that X * 128 doesn't overflow. This is true only if X is in the range [-1, 0] for i8. Similarly, BO1 is mul nsw X, 127, which requires that X * 127 doesn't overflow. For i8, this requires X to be in the range [-1, 1].\n\nSo when X is -1, both operations are valid. The code's transformation would be valid in this case, but when X is other values, like 1, X * 127 is 127, which is valid. X * 128 is 128, which is -128 in i8, but shl nsw would require that this doesn't overflow. Wait, shl nsw for i8 X=1, shl 7 would be 128, which is -128. But since the shl has nsw, this is allowed only if the shift doesn't overflow. However, shifting 1 left by 7 bits is 128, which is the minimum value in i8. The NSW flag is valid if the shift is a signed overflow. The NSW for shl is only valid if the shift amount is such that the result is the same as multiplying by a power of two, and the multiplication doesn't overflow. For example, shifting a positive number left and resulting in a negative number (due to overflow) would violate NSW.\n\nTherefore, the presence of NSW on the shl and mul indicates that the operations don't overflow. Therefore, when X is -1, both operations are valid. The code's transformation is allowed under these conditions. However, the transformation's result (-X) is only correct if srem (X*Y, X*Z) equals X * srem(Y,Z).\n\nBut in the test case, this is not the case when Y=128 and Z=127. The srem(Y,Z) is -1, so X * srem(Y,Z) is -X. However, the actual srem(X*Y, X*Z) is srem(-128, -127), which is (-128) % (-127) = -1. And -X is 1. But -128 % -127 is -1, not 1. Therefore, the transformation is incorrect.\n\nAh! So the code's transformation is incorrect in this case because srem(X*Y, X*Z) is not equal to X * srem(Y,Z) when X is negative. For example:\n\nX = -1, Y = 128, Z = 127.\n\nsrem(X*Y, X*Z) = srem(-128, -127) = -1.\n\nX * srem(Y,Z) = -1 * (-1) = 1.\n\nBut the correct result is -1, not 1. Therefore, the transformation is invalid.\n\nSo the code's transformation is incorrect because it assumes that srem(X*Y, X*Z) equals X * srem(Y,Z), but this is only true when X is positive. When X is negative, this is not the case.\n\nTherefore, the code needs to check that X is positive before applying this transformation. However, how can the code determine that X is positive? It may not have that information.\n\nTherefore, the code's logic is flawed because it allows the transformation when X could be negative. The fix is to only apply the transformation when X is positive, which is not possible in general. Therefore, the code's third condition is incorrect and should not be applied for srem when X can be negative.\n\nThe solution is to remove the transformation for srem when Y >= Z (signed) unless we can ensure that X is positive. However, that's not possible in the current code. Therefore, the code should not apply the third transformation for srem cases, or must impose additional constraints.\n\nGiven the test case's failure, the correct fix is to disable this transformation for srem when Y and Z are such that their srem is negative, which can happen when X is negative. Therefore, the code's third condition should be adjusted to check that the multiplication X * (rem Y,Z) does not introduce a signed overflow. However, this is complex.\n\nAlternatively, the code can restrict the third transformation to cases where Y and Z are positive, ensuring that X is positive. However, this may not be feasible.\n\nIn the original code, the transformation is applied under the conditions:\n\nYGECond (Y >= Z) for srem, and BO0HasNSW and BO1HasNSW.\n\nBut even with these conditions, when X is negative, the transformation is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct fix is to remove the third transformation for srem cases unless we can ensure that X is positive. Since the code cannot determine the sign of X, this transformation is unsafe and should be disabled for srem.\n\nThus, the code should remove the third condition for srem. Alternatively, add a check that Y and Z are positive, ensuring that X must be positive to avoid NSW overflow.\n\nIn the code, the third condition for srem requires that BO0HasNSW and BO1HasNSW. For the shl and mul to have NSW, X must be such that the operations do not overflow. For shl nsw X,7, X must be in the range [-1, 0] for i8. For mul nsw X,127, X must be in the range [-1, 1]. So the intersection is X in [-1,0].\n\nWhen X is -1:\n\nshl nsw X,7 \u2192 -128 (valid NSW)\nmul nsw X,127 \u2192 -127 (valid NSW)\n\nBut srem(-128, -127) is -1, which is not equal to X * srem(Y,Z) (which would be -1 * (-1) = 1).\n\nTherefore, the code's transformation is invalid for X=-1. Hence, the transformation is incorrect.\n\nThus, the code's third condition for srem is invalid and should be removed. Therefore, the fix is to disable the third transformation for srem.\n\nIn the code, the third condition is:\n\nif (YGECond && (IsSRem ? (BO0HasNSW && BO1HasNSW) : BO0HasNUW)) {\n\nWe need to modify this condition to prevent it from applying to srem cases where X can be negative. One way to do this is to require that Y and Z are positive, which would imply that X must be positive to avoid NSW overflow. However, checking whether Y and Z are positive is possible.\n\nSo, for srem, in addition to YGECond (Y.sge(Z)), we need to check that Y and Z are positive. Because if Y and Z are positive, then X must be positive to avoid NSW overflow in the original operations (shl and mul with NSW).\n\nTherefore, modifying the condition to:\n\nif (YGECond && (IsSRem ? (Y.isNonNegative() && Z.isNonNegative() && BO0HasNSW && BO1HasNSW) : BO0HasNUW)) {\n\nThis ensures that for srem, Y and Z are non-negative (positive or zero), and BO0 and BO1 have NSW. This way, X must be non-negative to avoid overflow, and thus X is non-negative. Therefore, srem(Y,Z) will be non-negative, and multiplying by X (non-negative) will give the correct result.\n\nIn the test case, Y is 128 (which is negative in i8), so Y.isNonNegative() is false. Therefore, the condition would not be met, and the transformation is not applied.\n\nThus, adding checks for Y and Z being non-negative for srem cases would fix the test failure.\n\nSo, modifying the code in the third condition:\n\nFrom:\n\nif (YGECond && (IsSRem ? (BO0HasNSW && BO1HasNSW) : BO0HasNUW)) {\n\nTo:\n\nif (YGECond && (IsSRem ? (Y.isNonNegative() && Z.isNonNegative() && BO0HasNSW && BO1HasNSW) : BO0HasNUW)) {\n\nThis change adds Y.isNonNegative() and Z.isNonNegative() checks for srem cases.\n\nIn the test case, Y is 128 (APInt(8,128)), which is negative, so Y.isNonNegative() returns false. Therefore, the condition is false, and the transformation is not applied. Thus, the code won't replace the srem with the incorrect sub instruction.\n\nThis should fix the test failure."

        "reasoning_content": "Okay, so I need to fix this LLVM test failure in the InstCombine pass related to the rem-mul-shl.ll test. The test is failing because the transformation isn't producing the expected result. Let me look at the problem again.\n\nThe original issue was a miscompilation in the simplifyIRemMulShl function. The test case involves an srem where the transformation was incorrectly replacing it with a sub instruction, leading to a wrong result when X is -1 (in i8 terms, 0xff). The correct result should be -1, but the transformation was giving 1 instead.\n\nLooking at the previous fix attempt, the code was modified to check if Y and Z are non-negative for the signed case (srem). But the test is still failing, which suggests that the transformation is still being applied when it shouldn't be, or the conditions aren't properly checked.\n\nThe error message from the test shows that the expected CHECK lines aren't matching. Specifically, the test expects certain instructions to be present after the transformation, but the actual output is different. For example, in the test case srem_XY_XZ_with_CY_gt_CZ_drop_nsw_commuted, the transformed code is generating a mul instead of the expected shl or some other instruction.\n\nLooking at the code in simplifyIRemMulShl, there's a condition for the srem case where Y >= Z and both Y and Z are non-negative. Maybe this condition is too restrictive or not correctly handled. Let me check the code again.\n\nIn the current code, for the srem case, the condition is:\n\nif (YGECond && (IsSRem ? (Y.isNonNegative() && Z.isNonNegative() && BO0HasNSW && BO1HasNSW) : BO0HasNUW)) \n\nThis checks if Y is greater than or equal to Z (sge), and for signed rem, it also checks that Y and Z are non-negative, and that both BO0 and BO1 have NSW flags.\n\nWait, in the failing test case, the operands are mul nsw i8 %X, 127 and shl nsw i8 %X, 7. Let's compute Y and Z here. For the shl, the code treats it as multiplying by 1 << 7, which is 128. So Y would be 128 and Z is 127. Y is 128, which in i8 is -128, and Z is 127. So Y.sge(Z) would be comparing -128 >= 127, which is false. Therefore, the condition YGECond would be false, so the transformation shouldn't apply. But maybe the code is miscalculating Y and Z when they are derived from shifts or muls with negative values?\n\nWait, in the test case, the code is:\n\n%BO0 = mul nsw i8 %X, 127\n%BO1 = shl nsw i8 %X, 7\n%r = srem i8 %BO1, %BO0\n\nThe shl by 7 is equivalent to multiplying by 128. So for the code, Y would be 128 (from the shl) and Z is 127 (from the mul). But in the code, when we calculate Y and Z, are we treating them as signed or unsigned values?\n\nIn the MatchShiftOrMulXC function, when the shift is matched, Y is calculated as 1 << Tmp, where Tmp is the shift amount. For a shift of 7, that's 1 << 7 = 128, which is 0x80 in i8, which is -128 in signed interpretation. Similarly, Z is 127 (0x7F), which is positive.\n\nSo Y is -128, Z is 127. Y.sge(Z) would be -128 >= 127, which is false. Therefore, the transformation shouldn't trigger here. But in the test case, the code was transformed into sub nsw i8 0, %X, which is incorrect. However, after previous fixes, maybe the code is no longer doing that, but now the test is expecting a different transformation.\n\nWait, the test failure now is about a CHECK line expecting a shl nsw instruction, but the transformed code is producing a mul instead. So the problem is that the transformation is not being applied when it should be, or another transformation is happening instead.\n\nWait, looking at the error message in the test:\n\nThe input was expecting:\n\n; CHECK-NEXT: [[BO1:%.*]] = shl nsw i8 [[X]], 7\n\nBut the actual output after transformation is:\n\n%r = mul nsw i8 %X, 127\n\nWhich suggests that the srem instruction was replaced by a mul, which is not correct. Wait, why is that happening?\n\nLooking back at the code for simplifyIRemMulShl, perhaps one of the conditions is triggering incorrectly. For example, the condition where RemYZ == Y and BO1NoWrap. Let's see.\n\nIn the test case, Y is 128 (0x80, -128), Z is 127 (0x7F). The srem of Y and Z is (-128) srem 127. Let's compute that. The srem is the remainder with the sign of the dividend. So -128 divided by 127 is -1 with a remainder of -128 - (-1)*127 = -128 + 127 = -1. So RemYZ is -1 (0xFF in i8). Since RemYZ is not equal to Y (-128), the condition RemYZ == Y is false, so that transformation isn't triggered.\n\nThe other condition is if RemYZ is zero, which it's not. Then the third condition is if Y >= Z (for srem, Y.sge(Z)), which is -128 >= 127? That's false. So none of the transformations should apply, and simplifyIRemMulShl should return nullptr, so InstCombine doesn't modify the srem.\n\nBut the test is expecting that the srem is transformed into a mul. Wait, but the original test case's expected transformation was incorrect. So maybe the correct fix is to disable the transformation when Y and Z are such that their signs differ, leading to a negative remainder.\n\nWait, the original problem was that the code was replacing the srem with sub nsw 0, X, which was wrong. The previous fix added checks that Y and Z are non-negative for srem. But in the test case, Y is -128 (from shl 7 of X=-1) and Z is -127 (from mul X, 127, X=-1). Wait, wait, let's re-calculate with X=-1.\n\nOriginal test case:\n\nX = -1 (i8: 0xff)\n\nBO0 = mul nsw X, 127 \u2192 -1 * 127 = -127 (i8: 0x81)\nBO1 = shl nsw X, 7 \u2192 -1 << 7 is -128 (i8: 0x80)\nsrem BO1, BO0 \u2192 -128 srem -127. The srem is computed as the remainder with the sign of the dividend. So -128 / -127 is 1 (since 1*-127 = -127, which is less than -128). The remainder is -128 - (1*-127) = -1. So the result is -1 (0xff), but the target transformation was returning 1. So the correct result is -1.\n\nThe previous incorrect transformation was replacing srem with sub nsw 0, X, which when X is -1 gives 1. But the correct result is -1, so that transformation is wrong.\n\nThe current code in simplifyIRemMulShl should not trigger any transformations for this case. But the test failure now indicates that the code is being transformed into a mul nsw i8 %X, 127, which is incorrect. How is that happening?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that in some other part of InstCombine, a different transformation is being applied. For example, after simplifyIRemMulShl returns nullptr, maybe another pass is transforming the code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code in simplifyIRemMulShl is still triggering in some cases where it shouldn't. Let me check the code again.\n\nIn the third condition:\n\n// (rem (mul nuw/nsw X, Y), (mul {nsw} X, Z))\n//      if Y >= Z and (for srem, Y and Z are non-negative)\n//          -> (mul {nuw} nsw X, (rem Y, Z))\n\nThe code checks YGECond (Y.sge(Z) for srem) and if Y and Z are non-negative. In the test case, Y is -128, Z is -127 (since X is -1, mul X, 127 is -127). Wait, no: wait, X is -1, so BO0 is mul nsw X, 127 \u2192 -1 * 127 = -127 (i8: 0x81), which is -127. So Z is 127? Wait, no. Wait, in the code, Z is the APInt extracted from Op1. How is Op1 constructed?\n\nIn the test case, Op1 is BO0, which is mul nsw X, 127. So in MatchShiftOrMulXC, Op1 is matched as a mul of X with 127, so Z is 127. Wait, but in reality, when X is -1, the actual value is -127, but the code is matching the constant operand (127) as Z. So Z is 127, not -127. So in the code, Z is 127 (APInt 127), and Y is 128 (APInt 128, which is 0x80 in i8, which is -128 when interpreted as signed).\n\nWait, but in the code, when we extract Y and Z, they are APInts. So for the shl instruction, which is shl nsw X, 7, the code treats Y as 1 << 7 = 128 (APInt 8, 128). However, 128 in 8 bits is -128 in signed integer. But the APInt value is 128, which is stored as an unsigned value. So when comparing Y.sge(Z), Y is 128 (APInt) and Z is 127 (APInt). The sge comparison between APInts considers them as signed values. So 128 in 8 bits is -128, which is less than 127. So Y.sge(Z) would be false.\n\nTherefore, the condition YGECond is false, so the third transformation is not triggered. Hence, simplifyIRemMulShl returns nullptr, and the srem remains as is. But the test is expecting that no transformation is applied. However, the test output shows that the srem is being transformed into a mul, which suggests that another part of the code is triggering a different transformation.\n\nWait, looking at the test case in rem-mul-shl.ll, the function is @srem_XY_XZ_with_CY_gt_CZ_drop_nsw_commuted. The original code is:\n\ndefine i8 @srem_XY_XZ_with_CY_gt_CZ_drop_nsw_commuted(i8 noundef %X) {\n  %BO0 = mul nsw i8 %X, 127\n  %BO1 = shl nsw i8 %X, 7\n  %r = srem i8 %BO1, %BO0\n  ret i8 %r\n}\n\nAnd the expected transformation after instcombine is:\n\ndefine i8 @srem_XY_XZ_with_CY_gt_CZ_drop_nsw_commuted(i8 noundef %X) {\n  %r = sub nsw i8 0, %X\n  ret i8 %r\n}\n\nBut according to the analysis, this transformation is incorrect. However, the test might have been written with an incorrect expectation. But the problem is that after the previous fix, the test is still failing, meaning that the code is not producing the expected output. Wait, but the error message says that the CHECK-NEXT line for [[BO1:%.*]] = shl nsw i8 [[X]], 7 is not found. That suggests that the test expects the shl to remain, but the actual output is a mul. Wait, maybe in the commuted test case, the srem operands are swapped?\n\nWait, the commuted test case's srem is %BO1, %BO0, which is (shl X,7) srem (mul X,127). The original code's test case may have the operands in the opposite order. However, in the code for simplifyIRemMulShl, both Op0 and Op1 are checked. Let me check the code.\n\nThe code first tries to match Op0 and Op1 as either mul or shl with X as a common factor. So in the test case, Op0 is shl X,7 (Y=128) and Op1 is mul X,127 (Z=127). The code would match X as the common factor, Y=128, Z=127. Then, since IsSRem is true, Y.sge(Z) is 128.sge(127) \u2192 in APInt's terms, comparing as signed values. But 128 in 8 bits is -128, which is less than 127. So Y.sge(Z) is false, and the condition for the third transformation isn't met. Hence, no transformation occurs, and the srem remains. But the test expects that the srem is transformed into a sub instruction. However, the correct result for this test case is that the transformation shouldn't happen. Therefore, the test's CHECK lines are incorrect. But the user is reporting that the test is failing because the transformation isn't applied, which suggests that the test is expecting a transformation that shouldn't occur. But the user's original problem was that the transformation was applied when it shouldn't, leading to a miscompilation.\n\nThis is confusing. The test failure indicates that the test expects a certain transformation, but the code is not producing it. However, the correct behavior is that the transformation should not be applied. So perhaps the test is wrong, and the fix is to correct the test's expectations. However, the user is asking to modify the code to fix the test failure. Alternatively, there's a flaw in the logic of the simplifyIRemMulShl function.\n\nWait, looking back at the code for the third transformation:\n\n// (rem (mul nuw/nsw X, Y), (mul {nsw} X, Z))\n//      if Y >= Z and (for srem, Y and Z are non-negative)\n//          -> (mul {nuw} nsw X, (rem Y, Z))\n\nIn the test case, the code is:\n\n%BO0 = mul nsw i8 %X, 127 \u2192 this is Op1, which is (mul X, Z) with Z=127\n%BO1 = shl nsw i8 %X, 7 \u2192 this is Op0, which is (shl X,7) \u2192 Y=128\nSo the code matches Op0 and Op1 as (mul/shl X, Y) and (mul/shl X, Z), and Y=128, Z=127. But since Y is 128 (which is -128 in i8) and Z is 127 (positive 127), Y is less than Z in signed comparison, so the Y >= Z condition is false. Therefore, the code should not trigger this transformation.\n\nBut in the test case, the code was previously transformed into sub nsw i8 0, X, which is incorrect. But after the fix, maybe that transformation is no longer happening, and the test is now expecting a different transformation. However, the test's CHECK lines are expecting certain instructions to be present, which are not there. For example, the CHECK line expects the shl to remain, but the code is being transformed into a mul.\n\nWait, the error message says that the CHECK-NEXT line for [[BO1:%.*]] = shl nsw i8 [[X]], 7 is missing. The actual code after transformation is producing a mul. So why is the mul being generated?\n\nAh, perhaps in the commuted test case, the code is being transformed in a different way. Let me check the commuted test case.\n\nThe commuted test case is:\n\ndefine i8 @srem_XY_XZ_with_CY_gt_CZ_drop_nsw_commuted(i8 noundef %X) {\n  %BO0 = mul nsw i8 %X, 127\n  %BO1 = shl nsw i8 %X, 7\n  %r = srem i8 %BO1, %BO0\n  ret i8 %r\n}\n\nThe expected transformation is:\n\ndefine i8 @srem_XY_XZ_with_CY_gt_CZ_drop_nsw_commuted(i8 noundef %X) {\n  %r = sub nsw i8 0, %X\n  ret i8 %r\n}\n\nBut according to the previous analysis, this is incorrect. However, after the first fix, this transformation is being prevented. So why is the test still expecting this?\n\nThe current code may not be applying the transformation, leading the test to fail because it expects the sub instruction, but the actual code remains as srem. However, the error message indicates that the CHECK lines are expecting the shl to be present, but instead, a mul is being generated. That suggests that another part of InstCombine is transforming the code.\n\nWait, maybe the test has multiple test cases, and the failing one is different. Looking at the error message:\n\nIn the input, the transformed code is:\n\n%r = mul nsw i8 %X, 127\nret i8 %r\n\nWhich suggests that the srem was replaced by a mul. That doesn't make sense. How could that happen?\n\nPerhaps another optimization is kicking in. For example, if the srem is simplified to a different expression. Let's think: srem (mul X, Y), (mul X, Z) is equivalent to X*Y srem X*Z. If X is non-zero, this can be transformed into X * (Y srem Z) if certain conditions are met. But in this case, Y is 128 and Z is 127. Y srem Z is -1 (as computed earlier), so X * (Y srem Z) would be X * -1. Which is equivalent to sub nsw 0, X. But the previous transformation was incorrect because when X is -1, this gives 1 instead of -1. Wait, no: sub nsw 0, X when X is -1 is 0 - (-1) = 1. But the correct result is -1. So why is this happening?\n\nAh, because when you multiply X by -1, you get -X. But if X is -1, then -X is 1. But the correct remainder is -1. So this transformation is invalid. Therefore, the code must not perform this transformation when Y srem Z is negative. Therefore, the transformation should only be applied when Y srem Z is non-negative. But in the case of Y=128 (which is -128) and Z=127, Y srem Z is -1, which is negative. So the code must not perform the transformation.\n\nBut why is the code generating a mul nsw i8 %X, 127? That seems unrelated. Wait, perhaps in the commuted test case, the code is being transformed differently. For example, maybe the code is swapping the operands of the srem.\n\nWait, srem is not commutative. srem a, b is not the same as srem b, a. So swapping the operands would change the result. But in the test case, the original code is srem BO1, BO0, which is (shl X,7) srem (mul X,127). If the code were to swap the operands, it would be invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another optimization is being applied. For example, if both BO1 and BO0 are multiples of X, then the srem could be simplified to X * ( (Y srem Z) ), but only if X is non-zero. However, when X is zero, the result is undefined (since division by zero is undefined). But in the test case, X is noundef, so the compiler can assume it's not zero.\n\nBut in the case where X is -1, Y=128 (which is X<<7), Z=127 (X*127). The srem is (X<<7) srem (X*127) = (-128) srem (-127) = (-128) - (1*(-127)) = -1. So the result should be -1. The transformation that replaces this with X * (Y srem Z) would compute X*(-1) = -X, which is 1 when X is -1, which is wrong. Hence, this transformation is incorrect.\n\nSo the code must only apply the transformation when Y srem Z is non-negative, ensuring that the multiplication by X does not change the sign in a way that invalidates the result.\n\nTherefore, the condition for the third transformation (Y >= Z and Y and Z are non-negative) is correct. However, in the test case, Y is -128 and Z is 127, which are not both non-negative, so the transformation should not be applied. Hence, the code should leave the srem as is.\n\nBut the test is expecting a transformation. This suggests that the test is incorrect. However, the user's original problem was that the transformation was applied when it shouldn't be, and now the test is failing because the transformation isn't applied, but the test expects it. This is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is matching the operands in a different way. For example, if the code is matching Op0 as the mul and Op1 as the shl, leading to Y=127 and Z=128. Let's check that.\n\nWait, the code matches Op0 and Op1 in the order they are given. In the commuted test case, Op0 is the shl (Y=128), Op1 is the mul (Z=127). If the code were to swap the order, but srem is not commutative. So perhaps there's a different code path that is being triggered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is allowing for the operands to be matched in either order. For example, if Op0 is mul X, Z and Op1 is mul X, Y, then the code would swap Y and Z, but since srem is not commutative, this would be incorrect.\n\nNo, the code in simplifyIRemMulShl is specifically matching Op0 and Op1 in the given order. The code first tries to match Op0 and Op1 as either mul or shl with X as the common factor. If that fails, it tries to match Op0 and Op1 as shl by X.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\nif (MatchShiftOrMulXC(Op0, X, Y) && MatchShiftOrMulXC(Op1, X, Z)) {\n    // pass\n} else if (MatchShiftCX(Op0, Y, X) && MatchShiftCX(Op1, Z, X)) {\n    ShiftByX = true;\n} else {\n    return nullptr;\n}\n\nSo in the commuted test case, Op0 is shl X,7 (Y=128), and Op1 is mul X,127 (Z=127). So MatchShiftOrMulXC(Op0, X, Y) would match the shl, setting Y=128. Then MatchShiftOrMulXC(Op1, X, Z) would match the mul, setting Z=127. So the code proceeds with Y=128, Z=127. Then, since IsSRem is true, Y.sge(Z) is -128 >= 127 \u2192 false. Hence, no transformation.\n\nThus, simplifyIRemMulShl returns nullptr, and the srem remains. But the test is expecting a transformation. Therefore, the test's CHECK lines are incorrect, but the user's environment is such that the test is failing because the code is not producing the expected transformation.\n\nBut according to the problem description, the user's code was previously generating an incorrect transformation, which was fixed, but now the test is failing because the code is not generating the expected (but incorrect) transformation. This indicates that the test needs to be updated, but the user is asking to modify the code to fix the test failure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another condition in the code that is allowing the transformation to proceed. Let me re-examine the code for simplifyIRemMulShl.\n\nLooking at the third condition:\n\n// (rem (mul nuw/nsw X, Y), (mul {nsw} X, Z))\n//      if Y >= Z and (for srem, Y and Z are non-negative)\n//          -> (mul {nuw} nsw X, (rem Y, Z))\n\nThe code checks:\n\nbool YGECond = IsSRem ? Y.sge(Z) : Y.uge(Z);\nif (YGECond && (IsSRem ? (Y.isNonNegative() && Z.isNonNegative() && BO0HasNSW && BO1HasNSW) : BO0HasNUW)) {\n    BinaryOperator *BO = CreateMulOrShift(RemYZ);\n    BO->setHasNoSignedWrap();\n    BO->setHasNoUnsignedWrap(BO0HasNUW);\n    return BO;\n}\n\nIn the test case:\n\n- Y is 128 (APInt 8, 128) which is -128 in signed. Y.isNonNegative() \u2192 false.\n- Z is 127 (APInt 8, 127) which is positive. Z.isNonNegative() \u2192 true.\n- BO0 is the shl instruction (Op0), which has nsw.\n- BO1 is the mul instruction (Op1), which has nsw.\n\nSo for the srem case, the condition is Y.isNonNegative() && Z.isNonNegative() \u2192 false && true \u2192 false. Hence, the condition is not met. Therefore, this transformation is not applied.\n\nThus, the code should not transform the srem into a mul or shift. So the srem should remain, and the test's CHECK lines should expect that. However, the test is expecting a transformation, which is why it's failing.\n\nTherefore, the correct fix is to update the test's expected output, but the user is asking to modify the code. Alternatively, there's a different part of the code that is causing the transformation to be applied.\n\nWait, maybe the code is allowing Y and Z to be treated as unsigned values in the srem case. For example, if Y.uge(Z) is used instead of Y.sge(Z). In the test case, Y=128 (0x80) and Z=127 (0x7F), so Y.uge(Z) is true because 128 > 127. If the code incorrectly uses uge instead of sge for the srem case, then the condition would be true, leading to an incorrect transformation.\n\nLooking back at the code:\n\nbool YGECond = IsSRem ? Y.sge(Z) : Y.uge(Z);\n\nThis is correct. For srem, it uses signed comparison, so Y.sge(Z) for srem.\n\nIn the test case, Y.sge(Z) is false, so YGECond is false. Hence, the transformation isn't applied.\n\nThus, the code seems correct, and the test's expected output is wrong. But the user's test is failing, so perhaps there's another issue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is triggering a different transformation. For example, when the srem is replaced by X * (Y srem Z), which is -1 * X. But when X is -1, this results in 1, which is incorrect. However, in the code, this transformation is only done if Y >= Z and Y and Z are non-negative, which isn't the case here.\n\nBut in the test case, the code is being transformed into a mul nsw i8 %X, 127, which is the BO0 value. That's strange. How does that happen?\n\nWait, in the commuted test case, the srem is %BO1, %BO0 \u2192 (shl X,7) srem (mul X,127). If for some reason the code is simplifying this to mul X,127, that would be incorrect. How could that happen?\n\nLooking at the code, perhaps one of the earlier conditions is triggered. For example, if RemYZ is zero, but in this case, RemYZ is -1. Or if RemYZ == Y, which it isn't. So those conditions are not met.\n\nAnother possibility is that the code is folding the srem into something else. For example, if the two operands are multiples of X, and X is known non-zero, then srem (X*A), (X*B) \u2192 X * srem(A,B). But this is only valid if X is known to be positive, or certain other conditions are met to preserve the sign.\n\nWait, there's a general algebraic identity: If X and B are non-zero and X divides both A and B, then (A srem B) = X * ((A/X) srem (B/X)). But this is only valid under certain conditions, such as X being positive. Otherwise, the sign of the remainder could be affected.\n\nIn the test case, A is shl X,7 (X*128) and B is mul X,127 (X*127). So the srem would be X*(128 srem 127) * (X / |X|) ? Not sure. But in any case, the code isn't supposed to apply this transformation unless X is positive.\n\nBut the code's current conditions for this transformation (third condition) require that Y >= Z and Y and Z are non-negative for srem, which isn't the case here. Hence, the code should not apply the transformation.\n\nTherefore, the test failure must be due to an incorrect expectation in the test. The correct behavior is that the srem remains, but the test is expecting it to be transformed into a sub or mul instruction, which is incorrect.\n\nHowever, the user is reporting that the test is failing, and they need to modify the code to make the test pass. This suggests that there's a flaw in the code that's causing the transformation to not be applied in cases where it should be, or the test's CHECK lines are incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is being compiled without certain optimizations, leading to different behavior. But that's unlikely.\n\nAnother possibility is that the code is handling the case where X is negative and Y and Z are positive, but the current code doesn't account for that. For example, when X is negative, multiplying by X could invert the sign of the remainder. Hence, the transformation X*(Y srem Z) would be incorrect.\n\nTo ensure that the transformation is valid, the code must guarantee that X is positive when Y and Z are positive. But since X can be negative, the transformation is only valid if the sign of X doesn't affect the remainder's computation. Which is not the case.\n\nTherefore, the code's current conditions are correct in requiring Y and Z to be non-negative for srem. The test case's transformation is incorrect, and the test needs to be updated.\n\nBut given that the user's environment requires the test to pass, perhaps the code needs to be adjusted to avoid triggering the transformation in this case. However, the current code already doesn't trigger the transformation. So why is the test failing?\n\nLooking back at the error message:\n\nThe test is expecting:\n\n; CHECK-NEXT: [[BO1:%.*]] = shl nsw i8 [[X]], 7\n\nBut the actual output after transformation is:\n\n%r = mul nsw i8 %X, 127\n\nWhich suggests that the srem is being replaced by the BO0 instruction. This is very strange. How could that happen?\n\nWait, maybe the code is being optimized by another part of InstCombine. For example, if the srem's operands are both multiples of X, and X is known non-zero, InstCombine might factor out X. But how?\n\nFor example, srem (X*A), (X*B) can be transformed to X * srem(A, B) if X is positive. But if X is negative, this is not valid. However, if the code is applying this transformation without checking the sign of X, it could lead to incorrect results.\n\nIn the test case, srem (X*128), (X*127). If X is -1, this becomes srem (-128, -127) = -1. If the code transforms this into X * srem(128, 127) \u2192 X*1 = -1*1 = -1, which is correct. Wait, srem(128,127) is 1 (since 128 /127 is 1 with remainder 1). But in 8-bit signed integers, 128 is -128, and 127 is 127. So srem(-128, 127) is -128 - ( -2 * 127 ) = -128 + 254 = 126. Wait, this is conflicting with the earlier calculation. So perhaps my earlier analysis was incorrect.\n\nWait, let's compute srem(-128, 127):\n\nThe quotient q is the integer toward zero. So -128 / 127 is -1 (since 127 * -1 = -127, which is greater than -128). Then the remainder is -128 - ( -1 * 127 ) = -128 + 127 = -1. So the srem is -1.\n\nBut if we factor out X (which is -1), then X * srem(128, 127) \u2192 -1 * (128 srem 127). The srem(128, 127) in unsigned terms is 1, but in signed terms, 128 is -128, and 127 is 127. So srem(128, 127) is -1. So X * srem(128,127) \u2192 -1 * (-1) = 1. Which is incorrect.\n\nSo the transformation X * (Y srem Z) is only valid if X is positive. If X is negative, the sign of the remainder is inverted, leading to an incorrect result.\n\nTherefore, the transformation is only valid when X is positive. But the code's current condition (Y >= Z and Y and Z are non-negative) ensures that Y and Z are positive, but X can still be negative. Hence, the transformation is unsafe.\n\nTherefore, the code's current condition is insufficient. It needs to also ensure that X is positive. But since X is a variable, it's not possible to determine its sign in general. Hence, the transformation is only valid when X is known to be positive. However, in the code, there's no check for X's positivity.\n\nTherefore, the transformation is incorrect and should not be applied unless X is known to be positive. Thus, the code's current conditions are flawed, and the transformation should be avoided unless X is known to be positive.\n\nThis suggests that the code's third condition is incorrect. Even if Y and Z are non-negative and Y >= Z, if X can be negative, the transformation is invalid. Therefore, the code must check that X is non-negative before applying the transformation.\n\nBut how can the code check that X is non-negative? It can only do that if there's some information from the context, such as range analysis or known bits. If X has the nsw flag, that might indicate that it's treated as a signed value, but it doesn't guarantee it's positive.\n\nAlternatively, the code could require that X is known to be non-negative via other means. But in the current code, there's no such check.\n\nThis means that the current code is incorrect and the transformation is being applied when it shouldn't be, leading to the miscompilation. The fix would be to add a check that X is non-negative when performing the transformation for srem.\n\nHowever, in the given test case, X is noundef but not known to be non-negative. Therefore, the code should not apply the transformation. Hence, the code's condition for the third transformation should include a check that X is non-negative.\n\nBut how to check that X is non-negative in the code? That requires additional analysis, which might not be feasible. Alternatively, the transformation should only be applied when the mul or shl operations can't overflow in a way that changes the sign.\n\nAlternatively, the code should not perform the transformation for srem unless it can prove that X is positive. Since that's not possible in general, the transformation should be disabled for srem, or only applied in cases where X is a positive constant.\n\nThis seems complicated. Given time constraints, perhaps the correct fix is to remove the transformation for the srem case when Y and Z are not non-negative. However, in the current code, the condition already checks that Y and Z are non-negative for srem. But in the test case, Y is -128 (APInt 128) which is treated as a signed value. However, the code's Y and Z are computed as APInt constants from the operands. For example, in the case of the shl X,7, Y is computed as 128 (APInt 8, 128), which is considered as a signed value of -128.\n\nBut the code's check for Y.isNonNegative() would return false for 128 in 8 bits, because in signed terms, it's negative. Therefore, the condition Y.isNonNegative() && Z.isNonNegative() is false, and the transformation isn't applied.\n\nThus, the code is correct, and the test's expected transformation is wrong. The test should not expect the srem to be transformed into a sub or mul instruction in this case. Therefore, the fix is to correct the test's CHECK lines to expect the srem to remain.\n\nHowever, the user is unable to modify the test and must adjust the code to make the test pass. This suggests that the code is not behaving as expected, but according to the analysis, the code is correct. This is a dilemma.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is being compiled with a different version of LLVM where the APInt's sge method behaves differently. For example, if the code compares the APInt values as signed or unsigned incorrectly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is using Y.uge(Z) instead of Y.sge(Z) for the srem case, leading to an incorrect transformation. Let me check the code:\n\nIn the code:\n\nbool YGECond = IsSRem ? Y.sge(Z) : Y.uge(Z);\n\nThis is correct. For srem, it uses signed comparison.\n\nBut in the test case, Y is 128 (APInt 8, 128), which is -128 in signed. Z is 127 (APInt 8, 127), which is 127 in signed. So Y.sge(Z) is -128 >= 127 \u2192 false.\n\nThus, YGECond is false, and the transformation is not applied.\n\nThus, the code is correct. The test's expected transformation is wrong, and the test should be updated. However, the user's test is failing because the code is not producing the expected transformation. Therefore, the correct solution is to update the test, but since the user is asking to modify the code, this suggests that there's a different issue.\n\nAnother possibility is that the code in simplifyIRemMulShl is not the only code path that handles this case. Maybe another part of InstCombine is transforming the srem. For example, if the code is simplified to X * Y srem X * Z \u2192 X * (Y srem Z) when X is non-zero. But this transformation is only valid if X is positive.\n\nHowever, in LLVM's InstCombine, such a transformation might be implemented in a different function. For example, in the visitSRem function in InstCombineMulDivRem.cpp. Let me check that.\n\nIn the visitSRem function, it calls commonIRemTransforms, which in turn might call simplifyIRemMulShl. If that returns nullptr, other transformations might be applied.\n\nAnother possible transformation is to simplify srem (X * Y), (X * Z) to X * srem(Y, Z) if X is non-zero. But this is only valid if X is positive. Let's see where this transformation is happening.\n\nIn simplifyIRemMulShl, the third transformation is trying to do this, but only when Y >= Z and Y and Z are non-negative. However, if X is negative, the result would be incorrect.\n\nTherefore, to fix this, the code should ensure that X is positive when applying this transformation. However, in the current code, there's no such check.\n\nThus, the code is incorrect and allows the transformation even when X is negative. To fix this, the code must add a check that X is positive. But how?\n\nOne way is to require that the multiplication or shift has a no signed wrap (NSW) flag, which implies that the operation doesn't overflow in a way that would wrap the sign. For example, if BO0 (mul nsw X, Y) has NSW, then X * Y doesn't overflow, which for NSW implies that the result is the same as the mathematical result in signed integers. This might imply that X and Y are such that their product doesn't overflow, but it doesn't directly imply that X is positive.\n\nAlternatively, the code could check that X is non-negative using known bits analysis. For example, if X is known to be non-negative, then the transformation is safe.\n\nHowever, adding such a check would require accessing the KnownBits information, which might not be readily available in this context. This could complicate the code.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the correct fix is to disable this transformation for srem unless X is a positive constant. However, since X is a variable, this might not be feasible.\n\nAlternatively, the code could drop the transformation for srem altogether unless certain conditions are met. For example, only apply the transformation if X is known to be positive via other analyses.\n\nBut given that the test case is failing because the code is not applying the transformation (as the conditions are not met), but the test expects it, the correct solution is to disable the transformation in more cases to avoid the miscompilation, even if it means the test will fail. However, the user's test is failing because the transformation is not applied, so this is a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code's condition for BO0HasNSW and BO1HasNSW is incorrect. For example, in the test case, BO0 is a shl nsw X,7, which has NSW. BO1 is mul nsw X,127, which also has NSW. So BO0HasNSW is true, BO1HasNSW is true.\n\nIn the third condition for srem:\n\n(IsSRem ? (Y.isNonNegative() && Z.isNonNegative() && BO0HasNSW && BO1HasNSW) : BO0HasNUW)\n\nIn the test case, Y.isNonNegative() is false (Y=128 in i8), Z.isNonNegative() is true (Z=127). So the condition evaluates to false. Hence, the transformation isn't applied.\n\nThus, the code is correct and the test is wrong. Therefore, the user should update the test's expected output. However, since the user cannot modify the test, they need to adjust the code to match the test's expectation, which might involve reverting the previous fix or adjusting the conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's calculation of RemYZ is incorrect. For example, if RemYZ is computed as Y.srem(Z), but Y and Z are being treated as signed values. In the test case, Y=128 (APInt 8, 128) is -128 in signed, Z=127 (APInt 8, 127) is 127. Then Y.srem(Z) is (-128) srem 127 = -1, which is correct. The code then creates a mul with RemYZ=-1. But if the code is creating a mul X, -1, that would be equivalent to sub 0, X. Which is what the test expects. However, in the code's current condition, this transformation is not being applied because YGECond is false.\n\nAh, wait! There's another part of the code:\n\n// (rem (mul X, Y), (mul nuw/nsw X, Z))\n//      if (rem Y, Z) == Y\n//          -> (mul nuw/nsw X, Y)\n\nThis condition checks if the remainder of Y and Z is Y itself, which implies that Y < Z in absolute terms. For example, if Y=3 and Z=5, then 3 % 5 is 3. So the remainder is Y, and the transformation replaces the srem with the original mul.\n\nIn the test case, Y=128 (APInt 8, 128) and Z=127 (APInt 8, 127). The srem of Y and Z is -1 (APInt 8, 255). So RemYZ is 255, which is not equal to Y (128). Hence, this condition isn't met.\n\nTherefore, this part of the code isn't triggered.\n\nThus, the code is correct, and the test is incorrect. The test's expected transformation is wrong, and the correct output should retain the srem. Therefore, the correct action is to update the test's CHECK lines, not the code. However, since the user's environment requires the test to pass, and they cannot modify the test, this suggests that the code must be adjusted to match the test's expectation, even if it's incorrect.\n\nBut that would reintroduce the miscompilation. Therefore, this is not a viable solution.\n\nGiven the time constraints and the information provided, the correct fix is to modify the code to avoid the transformation when Y and Z are not both non-negative for srem. Since the current code already does this, but the test is failing, it's possible that the test was originally correct and the code is missing a case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should apply the transformation only when the computed RemYZ is non-negative. For example, even if Y and Z are negative, if their srem is non-negative, the transformation is safe. But this requires additional checks.\n\nIn the test case, the srem is -1, which is negative. Hence, the transformation should not be applied. Thus, the code should not generate any transformation, and the test's CHECK lines are incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct solution is to update the test's CHECK lines to expect the original srem instructions. However, since the user cannot do this, the problem remains unresolved.\n\nGiven the time I have, I'll proceed to adjust the code's condition to further restrict when the transformation is applied. Perhaps requiring that the result of the srem is non-negative.\n\nModify the code's third condition to also check that RemYZ is non-negative for srem. For example:\n\nif (YGECond && (IsSRem ? (Y.isNonNegative() && Z.isNonNegative() && BO0HasNSW && BO1HasNSW) : BO0HasNUW)) {\n    // Check that RemYZ is non-negative for srem\n    if (IsSRem && RemYZ.isNegative())\n        return nullptr;\n    BinaryOperator *BO = CreateMulOrShift(RemYZ);\n    BO->setHasNoSignedWrap();\n    BO->setHasNoUnsignedWrap(BO0HasNUW);\n    return BO;\n}\n\nThis would ensure that for srem, even if Y and Z are non-negative, if the remainder is negative, the transformation is skipped. However, this might not be necessary because if Y and Z are non-negative and Y >= Z, then the remainder should be non-negative. Wait, for srem, if Y and Z are positive and Y >= Z, then the remainder is Y % Z, which is positive. For example, 5 srem 3 is 2. However, if Y is 3 and Z is 5, then the remainder is 3, which is positive. So perhaps adding this check is redundant. But in cases where Y and Z are non-negative but Y < Z, the code's third condition isn't triggered.\n\nIn any case, adding this check would prevent the transformation when RemYZ is negative. However, in the test case, even if Y and Z are non-negative, which they aren't, the code wouldn't apply the transformation if RemYZ is negative.\n\nBut in the test case, the code's third condition isn't triggered because Y and Z are not non-negative. Hence, this change wouldn't affect the test case.\n\nGiven the time constraints and the information provided, I think the correct fix is to modify the code's third condition to require that RemYZ is non-negative for srem, but this might not resolve the test failure. However, given the previous attempts, perhaps the code needs to avoid creating the mul instruction in cases where the sign of X affects the result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should not apply the transformation for srem at all. But that would disable correct transformations.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the correct code should not apply the transformation in the test case, and the test's CHECK lines are incorrect. Therefore, the fix is to update the test. However, since the user can't do that, the code must be modified to match the test's expectation, even if it's incorrect. But that would reintroduce the miscompilation.\n\nGiven the feedback from the previous attempts, the only way to make the test pass is to disable the transformation that was previously applied. Since the test expects a sub nsw instruction, but the code now generates a mul, perhaps the code needs to avoid generating the mul and leave the srem as is.\n\nBut according to the latest error message, the code is generating a mul instead of the expected shl. This suggests that another part of the code is triggering a different transformation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is now applying the transformation when Y and Z are swapped. For example, if Op0 is mul and Op1 is shl, leading to Y=127 and Z=128. But Y=127 and Z=128 would trigger Y.sge(Z) = false.\n\nThis is quite perplexing. Given time constraints, I'll proceed to modify the code's condition for the third transformation to include a check that Y and Z are both non-negative and that RemYZ is non-negative. This ensures that the transformation is only applied when the remainder is non-negative, preventing the incorrect transformation in the test case.\n\nHere's the modified code:\n\nIn the third condition:\n\n// (rem (mul nuw/nsw X, Y), (mul {nsw} X, Z))\n//      if Y >= Z and (for srem, Y and Z are non-negative and RemYZ is non-negative)\n//          -> (mul {nuw} nsw X, (rem Y, Z))\n\nbool YGECond = IsSRem ? Y.sge(Z) : Y.uge(Z);\nif (YGECond) {\n    if (IsSRem) {\n        if (!Y.isNonNegative() || !Z.isNonNegative() || RemYZ.isNegative())\n            return nullptr;\n        if (!BO0HasNSW || !BO1HasNSW)\n            return nullptr;\n    } else {\n        if (!BO0HasNUW)\n            return nullptr;\n    }\n    BinaryOperator *BO = CreateMulOrShift(RemYZ);\n    BO->setHasNoSignedWrap();\n    BO->setHasNoUnsignedWrap(BO0HasNUW);\n    return BO;\n}\n\nThis adds an additional check for srem that RemYZ is non-negative. In the test case, RemYZ is -1 (negative), so the transformation isn't applied. Thus, the code leaves the srem as is, and the test's CHECK lines should be updated. However, since the user can't do that, this might not resolve the test failure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the test's CHECK lines are expecting a different transformation due to a different code path. For example, if the code is now applying the transformation when Y and Z are swapped. But this is unlikely.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed to adjust the code as follows to include a check on RemYZ's sign for srem:\n\nModify the third condition's code block to:\n\nif (YGECond && (IsSRem ? (Y.isNonNegative() && Z.isNonNegative() && RemYZ.isNonNegative() && BO0HasNSW && BO1HasNSW) : BO0HasNUW)) {\n    BinaryOperator *BO = CreateMulOrShift(RemYZ);\n    BO->setHasNoSignedWrap();\n    BO->setHasNoUnsignedWrap(BO0HasNUW);\n    return BO;\n}\n\nThis adds a check that RemYZ.isNonNegative() for srem. In the test case, RemYZ is negative, so the transformation isn't applied. Hence, the code leaves the srem as is, which should match the test's original code, but the test's CHECK lines are expecting a transformation. Therefore, this change won't fix the test failure but is correct.\n\nBut according to the latest error message, the code is generating a mul instruction where the test expects a shl. This suggests that another transformation is being applied, possibly from a different part of the code.\n\nGiven the time and the information provided, I'll conclude that the code needs to avoid the transformation in the test case by ensuring that Y and Z are non-negative and RemYZ is non-negative for srem. The final code adjustment includes these checks."

        "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to fix this miscompilation in the InstCombine pass related to the `simplifyIRemMulShl` function. The test case that's failing is `srem_XY_XZ_with_CY_gt_CZ_drop_nsw_commuted`, which results in an incorrect transformation. The problem arises when the code transforms a `srem` into a `sub nsw` instruction, but in some cases, like when `X` is -1, this leads to wrong results.\n\nLooking at the Alive2 example provided, when `X` is -1 (which is 255 in i8), the source computes `srem -128, -127` which results in -1, but the target transformation returns 1. The root cause seems to be the transformation replacing `srem` with a subtraction when it's not valid in all cases.\n\nThe `simplifyIRemMulShl` function has a part where it checks if the remainder of Y and Z is equal to Y, which would mean Y is not divisible by Z, and thus the result is Y. However, when dealing with signed operations, especially when Y and Z are negative, this logic might not hold.\n\nIn the previous attempts, the code added checks for Y and Z being non-negative in the case of `srem`. However, the test failure indicates that even with those checks, there's a scenario where the transformation is incorrectly applied. \n\nLooking at the test case `srem_XY_XZ_with_CY_gt_CZ_drop_nsw_commuted`, the original code is:\n```\n%BO0 = mul nsw i8 %X, 127\n%BO1 = shl nsw i8 %X, 7\n%r = srem i8 %BO1, %BO0\n```\nHere, Y is 128 (from shl 7) and Z is 127. The code checks if Y >= Z, which is true (128 >= 127). However, since we're dealing with signed integers, 128 in i8 is actually -128, so when Y is -128 and Z is -127, Y.sge(Z) would be -128 >= -127, which is false. Therefore, the condition Y.sge(Z) is not met in the signed case when the values are negative, leading the code to not apply the transformation, which is correct. But in the test case, the transformation is still happening, which suggests a miscalculation in the conditions.\n\nWait, in the test case, the code is using `shl nsw i8 %X, 7`, which for %X = -1 would compute -1 * 128 = -128 (with nsw), and the mul is -1 * 127 = -127 (with nsw). The srem of -128 by -127 is indeed -1, but the transformation was replacing it with `sub nsw i8 0, %X`, which is 1 when %X is -1. So the code was incorrectly applying the transformation.\n\nLooking at the code in `simplifyIRemMulShl`, there's a section where if `RemYZ == Y` (i.e., Y % Z == Y), then it replaces the remainder with Y. But in the case of signed srem, this is only valid if Y and Z have the same sign. Otherwise, the remainder could have a different sign. For example, if Y is negative and Z is positive, the remainder would be negative, but if Y is positive and Z is negative, the remainder could be positive. But the code was not checking the signs of Y and Z here.\n\nIn the failing test case, Y is -128 and Z is -127. The srem of Y by Z is -1, but the code was expecting Y % Z to be Y (since Y < Z in absolute terms, but with same sign). Wait, in the case of srem, if the signs are the same, the remainder has the same sign as Y and Z. So for Y = -128 and Z = -127, Y.srem(Z) is -1, which is not equal to Y. Therefore, the condition `RemYZ == Y` is false, so that code path should not be taken. But perhaps in the code, when the original Y and Z are computed from the shifts or multiplies, there's an error in how they are represented as APInts, leading to incorrect comparisons.\n\nWait, in the code, when matching the shifts or multiplies, Y and Z are computed as APInts. For a shl nsw X, 7, the code represents Y as 1 << 7 = 128. But in reality, when X is negative, the shift could result in a negative value. However, the APInt representation here is treating Y as 128, which is a positive number, but in the actual code, the value is -128 (since it's an 8-bit integer). This discrepancy might be causing the code to incorrectly compute RemYZ as Y.srem(Z) where Y and Z are treated as positive numbers, leading to incorrect conclusions.\n\nAh, here's the problem. The code is capturing Y and Z as the multiplicative factors, but when those factors are derived from shifts or multiplies with negative values, the APInt representation doesn't account for the sign. For example, when the code matches `shl nsw X, 7`, it calculates Y as 1 << 7 = 128 (APInt(8, 128)), but the actual value in the program is -128 when X is -1. However, in the code's logic, Y is 128 and Z is 127 (from mul X, 127). Then, RemYZ = Y.srem(Z) would be 128.srem(127) = 1, but in reality, the program's Y is -128 and Z is -127, so srem is -128 % -127 = -1. The code's APInt calculation is treating Y and Z as positive, leading to incorrect transformations.\n\nTherefore, the code's logic for handling signed srem is incorrect because it's using the APInt values of Y and Z as if they are positive, which they might not be in the actual program. The code needs to consider the sign of the original values when computing Y and Z.\n\nWait, but how are Y and Z determined? Let's see: in the code, for a `shl X, C`, the code represents Y as 1 << C, but in the program, if X is negative, the shift with nsw would result in a negative value. However, the code's MatchShiftOrMulXC function captures Y as an APInt, which is the multiplicative factor, but when the operation is a shift, it's 1 << C. For example, `shl X, 7` is treated as X multiplied by 128 (1 << 7). But if X is negative and the shift has nsw, then the result is X * 128, which for X = -1 is -128. However, in the code's logic, Y is 128 (as an APInt), but in reality, the value is -128. Therefore, when the code computes Y.srem(Z), it's using the positive 128 and 127, leading to a remainder of 1, whereas the actual remainder in the program is -1.\n\nThis means that the code's logic is incorrect because it's not considering the sign of X when computing Y and Z. The multiplicative factors are treated as positive, but when X is negative, the actual values of the operands to srem are negative. Therefore, the code's transformation based on Y and Z's APInt values (as positive numbers) leads to incorrect conclusions about the remainder.\n\nTo fix this, when handling signed srem, the code needs to account for the sign of X. However, in the current setup, Y and Z are computed as the multiplicative factors (like 128 and 127), but the actual values of the operands depend on X's sign. Therefore, the transformations that assume Y and Z are positive (like Y >= Z) may not hold when X is negative.\n\nIn the failing test case, the code's logic checks if Y >= Z (128 >= 127, which is true), and then proceeds to replace the srem with a multiplication by (Y % Z) = 1. But in reality, when X is negative, the actual Y and Z are -128 and -127, so Y (as -128) is less than Z (as -127), making Y.sge(Z) false. Therefore, the transformation should not be applied. However, the code's APInt-based Y and Z are positive, leading to incorrect application.\n\nThe solution is to ensure that when dealing with signed srem, the code considers the signs of the actual values. However, since X can be any value, it's impossible to know statically whether X is positive or negative. Therefore, the transformation should only be applied when the multiplicative factors Y and Z are such that their signs are known to match, or the code can prove that the transformation is safe regardless of X's sign.\n\nAlternatively, the code should avoid applying the transformation when the multiplicative factors Y and Z could lead to different signs in the operands when X is negative. In the case of the failing test, since Y (128) and Z (127) are both positive, but when X is negative, the actual values become negative, leading to different behavior in srem.\n\nTherefore, the code's transformation for the case where Y >= Z (in the APInt sense) is only valid when X is non-negative. If X can be negative, then applying the transformation could lead to incorrect results. Thus, the code must ensure that X is non-negative when handling signed srem cases.\n\nBut how can the code ensure that X is non-negative? It could check if the operations (mul or shl) have the no-signed-wrap flag (nsw), which implies that the operation did not overflow in the signed sense. For a mul nsw X, C, if C is positive, then X must be such that the multiplication doesn't overflow. However, this doesn't directly imply that X is non-negative. For example, X could be negative but C is positive, and the multiplication doesn't overflow.\n\nAlternatively, the code could check that both Y and Z are positive. Since in the code's logic, Y and Z are derived from the multiplicative factors (like 128 and 127 in the test case), which are positive, but when X is negative, the actual operands to srem are negative. Therefore, the transformation that assumes Y and Z are positive is invalid for srem when X can be negative.\n\nTherefore, the code's transformation for the srem case when Y >= Z is only valid when both Y and Z are positive and X is non-negative. However, since the code cannot guarantee X's sign, this transformation is unsafe unless there's additional information about X's non-negativity.\n\nBut how does the original code handle this? Let's look at the code:\n\nIn the part where it checks:\n```\nbool YGECond = IsSRem ? Y.sge(Z) : Y.uge(Z);\nif (YGECond && (IsSRem ? (Y.isNonNegative() && Z.isNonNegative() && BO0HasNSW && BO1HasNSW) : BO0HasNUW)) {\n    BinaryOperator *BO = CreateMulOrShift(RemYZ);\n    BO->setHasNoSignedWrap();\n    BO->setHasNoUnsignedWrap(BO0HasNUW);\n    return BO;\n}\n```\nHere, for the srem case, it checks if Y and Z are non-negative and BO0 and BO1 have NSW. However, in the test case, Y is 128 (APInt(8, 128)), which in 8 bits is actually -128. So Y.isNonNegative() would return false because the APInt's sign bit is set. Therefore, this check would fail, and the transformation wouldn't be applied. Wait, but in the code, Y is captured as 1 << 7 = 128 (APInt(8, 128)), which is stored as 0x80. The method isNonNegative() for APInt checks the sign bit. For an 8-bit APInt 0x80 (128), the sign bit is set (bit 7), so isNonNegative() returns false. Therefore, in the test case, Y.isNonNegative() would be false, causing the condition to fail, and the transformation is not applied. But in the test failure, the transformation is being applied, leading to incorrect code. Why is this happening?\n\nWait, maybe in the code, the Y and Z captured are not being treated correctly in terms of their sign. Let's see:\n\nIn the test case, the code matches:\nOp0 is shl nsw X, 7 \u2192 Y = 1 << 7 = 128 (APInt(8, 128) \u2192 0x80, which is -128 in 8-bit two's complement).\nOp1 is mul nsw X, 127 \u2192 Z = 127 (APInt(8, 127) \u2192 0x7F, which is positive).\n\nSo in the code, Y is 0x80 (APInt with value 128, but in 8 bits, it's -128). However, when we call Y.isNonNegative(), APInt's isNonNegative() checks the sign bit. For 0x80 in 8 bits, the sign bit is set (bit 7 is 1), so isNonNegative() returns false. Similarly, Z is 0x7F (127), which has sign bit 0, so isNonNegative() returns true.\n\nThus, in the condition for the srem case:\n(Y.isNonNegative() && Z.isNonNegative()) \u2192 (false && true) \u2192 false.\n\nTherefore, the code should not apply the transformation. However, the test failure suggests that the transformation is being applied. So why is the code applying the transformation when Y.isNonNegative() is false?\n\nThis indicates that there's a mistake in the code's condition. Perhaps the code is not checking Y and Z's signs correctly. Let me look back at the code.\n\nIn the latest code provided, the condition for the srem case is:\n```\nif (YGECond) {\n    if (IsSRem) {\n      if (!Y.isNonNegative() || !Z.isNonNegative() || RemYZ.isNegative() ||\n          !BO0HasNSW || !BO1HasNSW)\n        return nullptr;\n    } else if (!BO0HasNUW) {\n      return nullptr;\n    }\n    BinaryOperator *BO = CreateMulOrShift(RemYZ);\n    BO->setHasNoSignedWrap();\n    BO->setHasNoUnsignedWrap(BO0HasNUW);\n    return BO;\n}\n```\nHere, YGECond is Y.sge(Z) for srem. In the test case, Y is 128 (APInt(8, 128)), which is -128, and Z is 127 (APInt(8, 127)). Y.sge(Z) compares them as signed values. -128 is less than 127, so Y.sge(Z) is false. Thus, YGECond is false, and the code does not enter this block. Therefore, the transformation should not be applied. But in the test case, the code is applying the transformation, leading to the error. So why is the transformation being applied?\n\nWait, the original code in the user's submission had a different condition. Let me check the previous code versions. In the first code provided, the condition was:\n```\nbool YGECond = IsSRem ? Y.sge(Z) : Y.uge(Z);\nif (YGECond && (IsSRem ? (BO0HasNSW && BO1HasNSW) : BO0HasNUW)) {\n    BinaryOperator *BO = CreateMulOrShift(RemYZ);\n    BO->setHasNoSignedWrap();\n    BO->setHasNoUnsignedWrap(BO0HasNUW);\n    return BO;\n}\n```\nBut in this case, Y.sge(Z) would be comparing Y (128) and Z (127) as signed, which is 128.sge(127) \u2192 true because APInt's sge compares them as signed values. But APInt(8, 128) is treated as -128, and APInt(8, 127) is 127. So -128.sge(127) is false. However, APInt's sge method treats the values as signed. So for two APInts, a.sge(b) returns true if a is greater than or equal to b when interpreted as signed integers.\n\nWait, APInt(8, 128) is 0x80, which is -128 in 8-bit signed. APInt(8, 127) is 0x7F, which is +127. So -128.sge(127) is false. Thus, YGECond would be false, and the code does not enter the block. However, in the first code version, the check for YGECond was combined with (IsSRem ? (BO0HasNSW && BO1HasNSW) : BO0HasNUW). In the test case, BO0 (shl nsw) has NSW, and BO1 (mul nsw) also has NSW. So BO0HasNSW and BO1HasNSW are true. But since YGECond is false, the condition YGECond && ... is false, and the code doesn't apply the transformation.\n\nBut in the test case, the transformation is being applied, which suggests that the code is applying a transformation when it shouldn't. This indicates that there's another code path that's being taken. Let's look at the other code paths.\n\nIn the code, after checking if RemYZ.isZero(), it checks if RemYZ == Y and BO1NoWrap. In the test case, RemYZ is Y.srem(Z) = (-128).srem(127) = -1. Y is 128 (APInt(8, 128) \u2192 -128). So RemYZ (-1) is not equal to Y (-128), so this condition is false.\n\nThus, none of the code paths should apply the transformation. However, the test failure indicates that the transformation is being applied. Therefore, the code must have a different logic in the version being tested.\n\nWait, perhaps the user's code has a different version. Let me check the latest code the user provided. In the latest code, the condition for the srem case is:\n\n```\n  bool YGECond = IsSRem ? Y.sge(Z) : Y.uge(Z);\n  if (YGECond) {\n    if (IsSRem) {\n      if (!Y.isNonNegative() || !Z.isNonNegative() || RemYZ.isNegative() ||\n          !BO0HasNSW || !BO1HasNSW)\n        return nullptr;\n    } else if (!BO0HasNUW) {\n      return nullptr;\n    }\n    BinaryOperator *BO = CreateMulOrShift(RemYZ);\n    BO->setHasNoSignedWrap();\n    BO->setHasNoUnsignedWrap(BO0HasNUW);\n    return BO;\n  }\n```\n\nIn the test case, YGECond is false (since -128 < 127), so this code path is not taken. But maybe there's another code path that is being triggered.\n\nLooking back at the code, the first check is for RemYZ.isZero(), which is false in the test case. The next check is if RemYZ == Y, which is false. Then, the YGECond is false, so nothing happens. Therefore, the code should return nullptr, and no transformation is applied. However, the test failure shows that the transformation is being applied, which suggests that the code is applying a different transformation.\n\nWait, perhaps the test case in question is not the one I'm looking at. The user's test case is `srem_XY_XZ_with_CY_gt_CZ_drop_nsw`, which in the code has:\n\n```\ndefine i8 @srem_XY_XZ_with_CY_gt_CZ_drop_nsw(i8 noundef %X) {\n  %BO0 = mul nsw i8 %X, 127\n  %BO1 = shl nsw i8 %X, 7\n  %r = srem i8 %BO1, %BO0\n  ret i8 %r\n}\n=>\ndefine i8 @srem_XY_XZ_with_CY_gt_CZ_drop_nsw(i8 noundef %X) {\n  %r = sub nsw i8 0, %X\n  ret i8 %r\n}\n```\n\nThe original code is transforming the srem into a subtraction, but this is incorrect. The code for this transformation must be happening elsewhere in the InstCombine pass, not in the `simplifyIRemMulShl` function. Therefore, the error may be in a different part of the code that's not shown in the user's provided snippets.\n\nHowever, the user's question is about modifying `simplifyIRemMulShl` in `InstCombineMulDivRem.cpp`. The error in the test case suggests that `simplifyIRemMulShl` is returning a transformation that replaces the srem with a multiplication by the remainder of Y and Z, but in this case, it's not correct.\n\nWait, in the original test case, the transformation is replacing `srem %BO1, %BO0` with `sub nsw i8 0, %X`. That's equivalent to `-X`. How does that relate to the code in `simplifyIRemMulShl`?\n\nThe code in `simplifyIRemMulShl` would check if `Y % Z` equals Y (which would mean Y < Z), but in this case, Y is 128, Z is 127. Y.urem(Z) is 1, which is not equal to Y. For srem, Y is 128 (APInt(8,128) \u2192 -128), Z is 127 (APInt(8,127) \u2192 127). srem of -128 by 127 is -1. So RemYZ is -1, which is not equal to Y (-128), so the code doesn't take the path where it returns `mul X, Y`.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is applying a different transformation. The test case's expected transformation is `sub nsw i8 0, %X`, which is `-X`. For %X = -1, this gives 1, but the correct result is -1. So the transformation is incorrect.\n\nBut how does this transformation relate to the code in `simplifyIRemMulShl`? It's possible that `simplifyIRemMulShl` is not the function responsible for this transformation. Maybe another part of the InstCombine pass is doing this.\n\nHowever, the user's initial problem states that the miscompilation is in `simplifyIRemMulShl`, so the error must be in that function. Therefore, perhaps the code in `simplifyIRemMulShl` is incorrectly returning a transformation when it shouldn't.\n\nAnother possibility is that the code is matching the wrong pattern. In the test case, Op0 is `shl nsw X, 7` (Y = 128), and Op1 is `mul nsw X, 127` (Z = 127). The code checks if Y >= Z, which for APInts 128 >= 127 is true, but when interpreted as signed 8-bit integers, Y is -128 and Z is 127, so -128 < 127. Therefore, Y.sge(Z) should be false. But if the code is comparing Y and Z as unsigned values (using uge instead of sge), then 128.uge(127) is true, leading to an incorrect transformation.\n\nAh, here's the mistake! In the code for `simplifyIRemMulShl`, the condition for YGECond is computed as:\n\n```\nbool YGECond = IsSRem ? Y.sge(Z) : Y.uge(Z);\n```\n\nBut in the case where IsSRem is true (srem), it uses Y.sge(Z). However, Y and Z are the multiplicative factors captured from the code. For example, in the test case, Y is 128 (from shl 7) and Z is 127 (from mul 127). When interpreted as signed 8-bit integers, Y is -128 and Z is 127. So Y.sge(Z) would be (-128).sge(127) \u2192 false. Thus, YGECond is false, and the code should not apply the transformation. However, if the code is mistakenly using uge for the srem case, then Y.uge(Z) is 128 >= 127 \u2192 true, leading to an incorrect transformation.\n\nWait, no. The code correctly uses Y.sge(Z) for srem and Y.uge(Z) for urem. So the code for YGECond is correct. Therefore, in the test case, YGECond should be false, and the code doesn't apply the transformation. But the test failure indicates that the transformation is applied, leading to the incorrect `sub` instruction.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is happening elsewhere, perhaps in a different part of the code. Alternatively, the code's logic for capturing Y and Z may be incorrect. For example, when the shift is `shl nsw X, 7`, the code captures Y as 1 << 7 = 128, but the actual value in the program is X << 7, which for X = -1 is -128. However, the code treats Y as 128, leading to incorrect conclusions.\n\nThe crux of the problem is that the code's logic for `simplifyIRemMulShl` is assuming that Y and Z are positive values, but when X is negative and the operations have nsw, the actual values of Y and Z are negative. Thus, the code's transformations based on Y and Z's APInt values (treated as positive) are incorrect.\n\nTo fix this, the code must account for the possibility that X could be negative, making the actual values of the operands to srem negative. Therefore, the transformations that rely on Y and Z being positive (like Y >= Z) are only valid when X is non-negative. However, since X's sign isn't known, the code can't safely apply these transformations unless it can prove X is non-negative.\n\nOne possible fix is to only apply the transformation for srem when the multiplicative factors Y and Z are positive and X is known to be non-negative. But how can the code determine that X is non-negative? It could check if the operations (mul or shl) with nsw imply that X is non-negative. For example, a `shl nsw X, C` implies that X is in the range such that the shift doesn't overflow. However, this doesn't necessarily mean X is non-negative. For example, shifting a negative number with nsw can still be valid if the result is within the range.\n\nAlternatively, the code can avoid applying the transformation for srem unless Y and Z are known to be positive. This would prevent the transformation in cases where Y or Z could be negative when multiplied by X.\n\nIn the test case, Y is 128 (captured as APInt(8, 128)), which is treated as a positive number in the code's logic, but when X is negative, the actual Y is negative. Therefore, the code's condition Y.sge(Z) is based on the APInt values, not the actual values in the program. To correct this, the code should consider the sign of X when evaluating Y and Z. But since X is a variable, the code can't know its sign at compile time.\n\nThus, the transformation in the code's current form is incorrect for srem when X can be negative. To fix this, the code should disable the transformation for srem unless Y and Z are both positive. This way, when X is negative, the signs of Y and Z would flip, but since Y and Z are positive in the code's logic, their actual values would be negative, leading to different srem behavior.\n\nTherefore, modifying the condition for the srem case to require that Y and Z are non-negative (in addition to other checks) would prevent the incorrect transformation. However, in the current code, this check is already present. For example, in the latest code:\n\n```\nif (IsSRem) {\n  if (!Y.isNonNegative() || !Z.isNonNegative() || RemYZ.isNegative() ||\n      !BO0HasNSW || !BO1HasNSW)\n    return nullptr;\n}\n```\n\nIn the test case, Y.isNonNegative() is false (since Y is 0x80, which is negative in 8 bits), so this check fails, and the code returns nullptr, not applying the transformation. But the test case's error shows that the transformation is applied, leading to a contradiction.\n\nThis suggests that the code being tested does not include this check. Perhaps the user's provided code snippets are not up to date, or the problem lies elsewhere. Given that the user has tried multiple iterations and the test failure persists, it's possible that the root cause is not in `simplifyIRemMulShl` but in another part of the code. However, the user's instruction is to modify `simplifyIRemMulShl`.\n\nAnother possibility is that the code's check for Y.isNonNegative() is incorrect. In the test case, Y is captured as 128 (APInt(8, 128)), which is treated as a signed value. The isNonNegative() method returns false for this APInt. Thus, the check !Y.isNonNegative() is true, causing the code to return nullptr.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\n```\nif (IsSRem) {\n  if (!Y.isNonNegative() || !Z.isNonNegative() || RemYZ.isNegative() ||\n      !BO0HasNSW || !BO1HasNSW)\n    return nullptr;\n}\n```\n\nIn the test case, Y.isNonNegative() is false, so !Y.isNonNegative() is true, which triggers the return nullptr. Thus, the transformation is not applied. But the test case's error indicates that the transformation is applied. This suggests that the code in the test environment does not have this check, or there's another code path that's being taken.\n\nThis implies that the code provided by the user in the previous steps does not include the necessary checks, leading to the transformation being applied incorrectly. To resolve this, the code must ensure that for srem, Y and Z are non-negative, and the remainder is non-negative, and both BO0 and BO1 have NSW flags.\n\nGiven that in the latest code version provided by the user, these checks are in place, but the test failure persists, perhaps there's an error in how these checks are implemented. For example, if RemYZ.isNegative() is checked, but in the test case, RemYZ is -1 (APInt(8, 255)), which is negative, so RemYZ.isNegative() is true, causing the code to return nullptr.\n\nThus, in the test case, the code should not apply the transformation, but the test failure shows that it does. This suggests that the code is not correctly implementing these checks, or another part of the code is responsible for the transformation.\n\nGiven the complexity, the solution is to adjust the condition to ensure that for srem, both Y and Z are positive, and the remainder is non-negative. Additionally, ensure that the transformation is only applied when these conditions are met. This would prevent the transformation in cases where X is negative, leading to incorrect results.\n\nAnother approach is to recognize that the transformation for srem (mul X Y) srem (mul X Z) to mul X (Y srem Z) is only valid when X is non-zero and Y and Z are positive. However, without knowledge of X's sign, this is unsafe. Therefore, the code should avoid this transformation for srem unless it can prove X is positive.\n\nAlternatively, the code can replace the srem with X multiplied by (Y srem Z) only when Y and Z are positive. This way, even if X is negative, the multiplication's sign is handled correctly. However, this requires that Y srem Z is computed correctly considering their signs.\n\nBut since Y and Z in the code are derived from the multiplicative factors (e.g., shl X, C \u2192 Y = 1<<C), which are positive, the code's current logic treats them as positive. However, when X is negative, the actual values become negative, leading to a different srem result. Therefore, the transformation is only safe if X is positive, which the code cannot guarantee.\n\nThus, the correct fix is to disable this transformation for srem unless there's additional information about X's non-negativity. Since the code cannot infer that, the transformation should be removed for srem cases, or additional checks should be added to ensure X is non-negative.\n\nGiven the test case's failure, the code must be adjusted to not apply the transformation for srem when Y and Z are positive but X can be negative. Therefore, in the code's `simplifyIRemMulShl` function, the condition for the srem case should be modified to only apply when Y and Z are positive and X is known to be non-negative. However, since determining X's non-negativity is not trivial, the safest fix is to remove the srem transformation or add stricter checks.\n\nIn conclusion, the code in `simplifyIRemMulShl` should not apply the transformation for srem when Y and Z are positive but X can be negative. This can be achieved by removing the srem case or adding checks that Y and Z are positive and X is known to be non-negative. Since the latter is complex, the immediate fix is to disable the transformation for srem in cases where Y and Z are positive but X's sign is unknown.\n\nThe final code adjustment would involve removing the srem handling in the problematic code path or adding additional conditions to prevent the transformation when X could be negative. Given the provided code snippets, the fix would involve modifying the condition in the `simplifyIRemMulShl` function to avoid applying the transformation for srem unless certain safety conditions are met."
